Onchain IPFS
Store files referenced by Ethereum L1, on L2!

Fields for a file: type (plaintext - includes SVG, JSON, etc -, base64), full or partial, if partial use tx ID so now new option: if it is alone in the tx or if there's more text around

-

Also come with a Bash script (ipfs-onchain) that will fetch Base to download a CID and locally validate the result. This script will be used by GIPFS' IPFS wrapper.
-
So, GIPFS ipfs wrapper will fetch files using this priority: gateway, blockchain, IPFS network
