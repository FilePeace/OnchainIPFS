Onchain IPFS
Store files referenced by Ethereum L1, on L2!

Logotype: IPFS logotype but Base's blue and instead of "IPFS": "OFS"

search if this is already a thing

Fields for a file: type (plaintext - includes SVG, JSON, etc -, base64), full or partial, if partial use tx ID so now new option: if it is alone in the tx or if there's more text around, filename (optional), split-parts (optional, if file is split in parts due to being too large for a single tx - comma-separated tx URIs)
-
Can add filename to an already existing file, but requires owning it
-
After publishing a file, will receive an NFT with its ID or filename on the img, plus the CID

-

Also come with a Bash script (ipfs-onchain) that will fetch Base to download a CID and locally validate the result. This script will be used by GIPFS' IPFS wrapper.
-
So, GIPFS ipfs wrapper will fetch files using this priority: gateway, blockchain, IPFS network
